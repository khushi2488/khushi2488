# Hi, I'm Khushi Patel ðŸ‘‹

## About Me  

I'm a passionate **Python developer** and a recent **Computer Engineering graduate** from Government Engineering College, Gandhinagar. I have a strong interest in **open-source contributions** and love **Problem Solving** challenges.  

Through open-source, Iâ€™ve gained practical experience in collaborating with developers, fixing bugs, adding features, and improving project documentation. I actively contribute to **GitHub repositories** and believe in giving back to the community while enhancing my coding skills.  

I also enjoy sharing my knowledge through **technical blogs** on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/khushi2488).
